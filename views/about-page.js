          <h2 class="title is-5">What is liquid democracy?</h2>
          <p>Liquid democracy combines elements of direct and electoral democracy to create a better system of representation. Pick anyone you trust to represent you and represent others when you vote.</p>

          <p>Choose and rank your representatives. If you donâ€™t vote on a proposal, the top person on your list who has voted would determine your vote as well. If none of them vote, then their representatives determine your vote. Visit <a href ="demo.liquid.us">demo.liquid.us</a> to see how this works.</p>

          <p>This network of trusted representatives allows us to gauge public opinion on any specific policy proposal.</p>
